The pages above allow you to create news and edit news in the archive as well as select what is currently featured on the front page.
<br/><br/>
The front page feature isn't "live" yet, so instead below you will find the example of what the featured content would be listed as:
<?php include ('../featnews.php'); ?>
<br/><br/>
This news uses XML.  The xml feed is available at: <a href="../news.xml" target="_blank">news.xml</a> and can be read into RSS feed readers.
<br/><br/>
<?php include ('news_edit.php'); ?>
